<h1>Marc's favourite movies</h1>

    But anyways: I'll just to it!

<h2>My favourite three movies<br>
    (that i can think of at the moment)</h2>
<h3>My number one: Avatar</h3>
<p>Yes, this movie was just amazing. The visuals, the action, the epicness.
    But mostly its main theme: the spiritual connection of the people to LIFE itself.
    And also the biology is pretty well done. It was just so much better than everything at the time!
</p>
<h3>Number two: Interstellar</h3>
<p>Well, to be honest I don't really know. I would have to think more about it.
    Maybe there are some other great movies of another genre that are better.
    But in this "epicness" genre this one was also very very good.
</p>
<h3>Number three: Life as a house</h3>
<p>Now this one is more or less a place holder here representing its genre.
    Because it's not ONLY epic movies that I like. Emotional ones can be awesome, too.
    So at the time, when I was young, I really liked that one. So i put it here.
</p>
<h3>Also a good one:</h3>
